# Introduction

pinocchIO is a file format, a C library and a set of tools for storing audiovisual document descriptors.
pinocchIO is meant to be an easy way for researchers working in the wide area of content-based multimedia analysis to store and share any kind of time-indexed description of the content.

The notion of time-indexed description includes (but is not restricted to) labelled and unlabelled segmentations of a multimedia document, low-level descriptors directly extracted from an audio signal or the frames of a video, as well as manual or automatic semantic annotations of the document.

pinocchIO does NOT provide the necessary tools to automatically extract these from an audiovisual document. It is a way for the members of the community to store and share the output of their own tools.
