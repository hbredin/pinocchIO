 pinocchIO file format can be summarized by the following equation.
 
 <center><b>one medium + multiple descriptions = one pinocchIO file</b></center>
 
 The idea behind pinocchIO is to be able to store and organize all the information
 related to a given medium into one single file.
 
 \section oneone One medium per pinocchIO file
 
 Each pinocchIO file must only contain descriptions related to one medium.
 Therefore, any pinocchIO file contains a <b>specific area</b> where <b>the path 
 to the medium is stored</b> as soon as the pinocchIO file is created.
 
 For instance, one can used the @ref pioinit command line tool to
 create a new pinocchIO file <i>MyVideo.pio</i> corresponding to the video <i>MyVideo.avi</i>
\verbatim
 $ pioinit /path/to/MyVideo.avi /another/path/to/MyVideo.pio
\endverbatim
 
 \section onemultiple Multiple descriptions per pinocchIO file
 
 Traditionnally, one would store one kind of descriptors into one file and another
 one into another file -- thus leading to a complex and cluttered collection of files.
 
 For instance, one would store 
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel-frequency_cepstrum">MFCC</a> coefficients
 extracted from the audio stream of a video into one file (e.g. <i>audio.mfcc</i>),
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-invariant_feature_transform">SIFT</a>
 descriptors computed from every frame of the video into another file (e.g <i>MyVideo.sift</i>),
 and two versions of speaker diarization results into two other files 
 (e.g. <i>MyVideo.spk.v1</i> and <i>MyVideo.spk.v2alpha</i>).
 
 \subsection filesystem Internal file system
 
 pinocchIO files reproduce the file system paradigm internally.
 Therefore, it is possible to store all of these descriptors into one unique file
 (e.g. <i>MyVideo.pio</i>). 
 
 To continue with the previous example, one could choose to store MFCC coefficients
 at internal path <i>/audio/mfcc</i>, SIFT descriptors at <i>/video/sift</i> and speaker diarization
 results into <i>/audio/SpeakerDiarization/v1</i>
 and <i>/audio/SpeakerDiarization/v2a</i>.
  
 \subsection description Mandatory description 
 
 In the above example, two speaker diarization approaches are available -- 
 called <i>v1</i> (version 1), and <i>v2alpha</i> (version 2, alpha).
 It might as well be <i>potato</i> and <i>asparagus</i>! In a month or two, will you
 remember what was the difference between them?

 pinocchIO allows to store a textual description with every single descriptor
 store in a pinocchIO files. For instance, <i>v1</i> description could be\n 
 <center><i>Speaker diarization using  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture_model">GMMs</a> with 512 gaussians</i></center>
 while <i>v2alpha</i> would be described by\n
 <center><i>Speaker diarization using 4-states <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model">HMMs</a></i></center>
 
 pinocchIO even goes one step further by <b>preventing</b> any descriptor to be <b>created without any
 textual description</b>, and <b>systematically asks for one</b> when it is created.
 
 Overall, the final pinocchIO file <i>MyVideo.pio</i> might look like that:
 
\verbatim
==============================
==== /path/to/MyVideo.avi ====
==============================
/audio/
  mfcc ....................... MFCC coefficients
  SpeakerDiarization/
    v1 ....................... Speaker diarization using
                               GMM with 512 gaussians
    v2alpha .................. Speaker diarization using
                               4-states HMMs
/video/
  sift ....................... SIFT descriptors
\endverbatim

 \section timelinevsdataset Timelines vs. datasets
    
 Depending on the nature of the description, two types of path can be created
 within a pinocchIO files.
 
 <b>Timelines</b> can be used to store raw temporal segmentation of the medium, such 
 as shot boundary detection or story segmentation for instance.
 
 <b>Datasets</b>, on the other hand, are meant to store actual data extracted from the medium.
 This includes MFCC coefficients extracted every few milliseconds, speaker diarization
 results (who is speaking and when), timestamped subtitles, etc.
  
 \par Definition:
 A timeline is a list of chronologically ordered time ranges
 
 \image	html timeline.png "Three valid timelines"
 \image	latex timeline.eps "Three valid timelines" width=\textwidth

 The first timeline is a partition of the medium duration. Think of it as the output of 
 a shot boundary detection algorithm, for instance.
 
 The second timeline shows that it is acceptable for a timeline to contain overlapping
 time ranges and <i>holes</i>. This timeline could be used as the (unlabelled) output of a
 speaker diarization system where each segment corresponds to a speaker: two speakers
 can obviously speak simultaneously and there are times when nobody is speaking. 
 
 The third timeline shows that time ranges do not have to be included in the duration
 of the medium. For instance, MFCC coefficients are often computed on a sliding window
 centered on the current temporal position -- consequently, the very first position of
 the window might start before the beginning of the medium.
  
 See \ref ascii2pio and \ref timeline for more information on how to create a timeline.
 
 \par Definition:
 A dataset is a collection of sets of D-dimensional vectors aligned with a timeline.
 
 \image	html dataset.png "A dataset aligned with the first timeline"
 \image	latex dataset.eps "A dataset aligned with the first timeline" width=\textwidth
 
 Dimension D and type of values (char, integer, float or double) are set once and 
 for all when the dataset is created.
 However, the number of vectors can vary from one time range to another.

 For instance, SIFT descriptors are usually stored as 128-dimensional float vectors.
 However, their number can vary from one frame to another.
 
 Dataset can also be used to store textual descriptors as string.
 Simply create a dataset of 1-dimensional char vectors and store N vectors where
 N is the length of the string.

 \section attributes Attributes
 
 pinocchIO would not be complete without a proper way of attaching named metadata to 
 a timeline, a dataset or the whole pinocchIO file: that is what attributes are for.
 
 It is possible to attach metadata to any pioncchIO object (timeline, dataset, or file) 
 as char, int, float, double or even string.
 
 See \ref attribute "attributes API" for more information on how to read and write attributes.
